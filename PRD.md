# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Prompts CLI Tool & Multi-Frontend Prompt Management Solution

This document outlines the requirements for building a multi-frontend prompt management system aimed at developers working with large language models (LLMs). The system helps developers **store, retrieve, edit, and reuse prompts** easily across various environments. The project consists of several repositories to cover different frontends and integration points.

## Executive Summary

Developers using LLMs today face challenges in managing the transient prompts they create, often losing valuable prompts or spending extra effort reconstructing them. The Prompts solution provides **a unified platform to persist and manage prompts effectively** with seamless access through multiple frontends developers commonly use: CLI, Terminal UI, Desktop application, Neovim integration, and Web PWA.

## Product Overview

### Problem Statement

Prompt crafting for LLMs is iterative and transient, frequently leading to loss of valuable prompt templates and workflows. Developers need a dependable system to **store, organize, and reuse prompts** efficiently without disrupting their existing workflows or switching between many disparate tools.

### Solution Approach

Create a modular, cross-platform **Prompt Management Solution** that offers:

- A **core prompt management service** implemented in Rust with rich CLI capabilities.
- Multiple frontends to leverage the core service:
  - **CLI frontend** using Clap (repository: `julwrites/prompts-cli`)
  - **Terminal UI (TUI)** using Ratatui (within the CLI repo)
  - **Desktop application** using Tauri (within the CLI repo)
  - **Neovim plugin** facilitating prompt management inside the editor (repository: `julwrites/prompts-nvim`)
  - **Web Progressive Web App (PWA)** for accessible browser-based UI (repository: `julwrites/prompts-pwa`)

### Target Audience

- Developers who utilize LLMs for software development, content generation, or automation.
- Users who need to manage numerous prompt templates across various projects.
- Those who desire consistency and efficiency in interacting with LLM prompts across CLI, terminal, desktop, and editor environments.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Architectural Principles

A **layered modular architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

- **Core Prompt Management Service** (business logic, data storage, and API)
  - Written in Rust
  - Common prompt store accessible by all frontends
  - Storage format: local filesystem / optional sync later
  - Features: CRUD operations, search, filtering, tagging

- **Frontends**
  - **CLI (Clap)** — command-based interface with all core interactions
  - **Terminal UI (Ratatui + Crossterm)** — interactive terminal-based UI within CLI repo
  - **Desktop app (Tauri + React)** — desktop GUI with native OS integration within CLI repo
  - **Neovim plugin (Lua)** — lightweight integration calling the CLI tool
  - **Web PWA (React/Vue + Rust backend or API proxy)** — separate repo `julwrites/prompts-pwa`

### Data Storage

- Use serialized JSON or TOML files for local prompt persistence.
- Indexed in-memory data structures for fast lookup.
- Consider SQLite or other embedded DB for future scalability.

### Communication Patterns

| Frontend   | Communication Method                          |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|
| CLI/TUI    | Direct function calls inside Rust process     |
| Desktop   | Tauri’s RPC commands invoking Rust core       |
| Neovim    | External CLI invocation via `vim.fn.jobstart` |
| Web PWA    | API calls to Rust backend or WASM module      |
