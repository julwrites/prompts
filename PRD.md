# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Prompts CLI Tool & Neovim Plugin

This document outlines the requirements for developing a multi-frontend CLI tool in Rust with accompanying Neovim plugin integration, designed to enhance developer productivity through intuitive prompt management and text generation capabilities.

## Executive Summary

The Prompts project consists of two complementary repositories: a core Rust CLI application (`julwrites/prompts-cli`) providing multiple frontend interfaces, and a Neovim plugin (`julwrites/prompts-nvim`) that integrates with the installed CLI tool[1][2]. This architecture enables developers to access prompt management functionality across multiple interfaces while maintaining consistency and performance.

## Product Overview

### Problem Statement

Developers frequently work with various prompting tools and text generation workflows but lack a unified, efficient interface that adapts to different working environments[3]. Current solutions often require switching between multiple applications or suffer from performance limitations when processing large datasets.

### Solution Approach

The Prompts tool addresses this challenge by providing a modular architecture with three distinct frontends:
- Command-line interface for script automation and quick operations[1][4]
- Terminal User Interface (TUI) for interactive workflows[5][6]
- Tauri desktop application for rich graphical interactions[7][8]
- Neovim integration for seamless editor-based functionality[9][10]

### Current Status

As of today, the core CLI and TUI frontends are largely implemented. The project includes:
- **Core Rust Library (`prompts_core`):** Defines `Prompt` structure, `load_prompts` function, and an extensible `TextGenerator` trait with `MockTextGenerator` and `LLMTextGenerator` (placeholder) implementations.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Implements `list`, `show`, and `generate` subcommands. The `generate` subcommand supports selecting between mock and LLM (placeholder) backends.
- **Terminal User Interface (TUI):** Provides an interactive interface for browsing, selecting, editing, and previewing generated text for prompts. It integrates with the `TextGenerator` trait.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** GitHub Actions are configured for cross-platform testing (Linux, macOS, Windows) and automated publishing to `crates.io` upon merge to `main`.

### Target Audience

The primary users are software developers who:
- Work extensively with text processing and generation tools
- Utilize multiple development environments
- Value performance and efficiency in their workflows
- Require seamless integration with existing tools
