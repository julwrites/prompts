# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Prompts CLI

This document outlines the requirements for building a command-line interface (CLI) for managing prompts for large language models (LLMs).

## Executive Summary

The Prompts CLI provides developers with a powerful and efficient way to store, retrieve, edit, and reuse prompts directly from the command line. This tool is designed to integrate seamlessly into existing developer workflows, minimizing context switching and maximizing productivity.

## Product Overview

### Problem Statement

Developers who work with LLMs frequently create and reuse a variety of prompts. Managing these prompts can be cumbersome, often involving scattered text files or notes. A dedicated CLI tool is needed to bring structure and efficiency to this process.

### Solution Approach

The Prompts CLI will be a feature-rich command-line tool built in Rust using the Clap library. It will provide a comprehensive set of commands for all aspects of prompt management.

### Target Audience

- Developers who utilize LLMs for software development, content generation, or automation.
- Users who are comfortable working in a command-line environment.
- Anyone who needs to manage a large collection of prompts efficiently.

## Product Goals and Success Metrics

| Goal                               | Success Metric                               | Target                          |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Efficient prompt management       | Time to create, find, and use a prompt       | < 10 seconds per operation     |
| Seamless workflow integration     | User adoption and positive feedback          | >95% adoption in test users    |
| Cross-platform compatibility      | Builds and runs on Linux/macOS/Windows       | 100% supported platforms       |

## User Stories

| Story ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Priority |
|----------|------------|---------------------|----------|
| US-001 | As a developer, I want to store prompts so that I can reuse them later easily. | Prompts can be saved with a title, tags, and categories. | P0 |
| US-002 | As a user, I want to retrieve prompts quickly using search or filters so that I can find the right prompt immediately. | Indexed search by text, tag, and category; fast results. | P0 |
| US-003 | As a developer, I want to edit existing prompts to refine them over time. | In-place editing and save confirmation. | P0 |
| US-005 | As a CLI user, I want to interact with the prompt manager via commands using Clap. | Supports commands for `add`, `list`, `edit`, and `delete`. | P0 |

## Technical Architecture

The CLI will be built in Rust using the Clap library for command-line argument parsing. It will interact with a local file-based storage system for prompts, likely using JSON or a similar format.

## Feature Specification

- **Prompt CRUD**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete prompts.
- **Prompt Metadata**: Titles, tags, and categories for organization.
- **Search and Filtering**: Text-based search with filtering by tag and category.
- **Help and Documentation**: Integrated help commands with examples.
- **Configuration Management**: Support for environment variables and configuration files.
