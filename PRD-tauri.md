# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Prompts Tauri

This document outlines the requirements for building a desktop application for managing prompts for large language models (LLMs) using the Tauri framework.

## Executive Summary

The Prompts Tauri application will provide a polished, user-friendly, and cross-platform desktop experience for managing prompts. It is designed for users who prefer a graphical user interface (GUI) and the features that a native desktop application can provide.

## Product Overview

### Problem Statement

For users who are less comfortable with command-line interfaces, or for those who prefer a more feature-rich graphical environment, a dedicated desktop application is the ideal solution for prompt management.

### Solution Approach

The Prompts Tauri application will be a desktop application built using Tauri, with a web-based frontend (likely using a framework like React or Vue) and a Rust backend. It will be part of the `prompts-cli` repository, but will be built and distributed as a separate application.

### Target Audience

- Users who prefer a graphical user interface (GUI) for their applications.
- Developers and content creators who want a dedicated and powerful tool for managing their prompts.
- Users who want a consistent prompt management experience across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux).

## Product Goals and Success Metrics

| Goal                               | Success Metric                               | Target                          |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| User-friendly prompt management   | High user satisfaction and positive reviews  | High ratings in app stores/feedback channels |
| Native desktop experience         | Seamless integration with the host OS        | Use of native notifications, menus, etc. |
| Cross-platform compatibility      | Builds and runs on Linux/macOS/Windows       | 100% supported platforms       |

## User Stories

| Story ID | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Priority |
|----------|------------|---------------------|----------|
| US-007 | As a desktop app user, I want a user-friendly UI for managing prompts with drag & drop and rich controls. | Tauri app with native integrations and a smoother UX. | P1 |
| US-013 | As a desktop user, I want to be able to use my mouse to navigate the application and interact with my prompts. | The application is fully navigable with a mouse. | P1 |
| US-014 | As a desktop user, I want to receive native notifications for certain events (e.g., when a prompt is successfully saved). | The application uses the OS's native notification system. | P1 |
| US-015 | As a desktop user, I want to be able to customize the application's appearance (e.g., with a light or dark theme). | The application provides theme customization options. | P2 |

## Technical Architecture

The application will be built using the Tauri framework. The frontend will be a single-page application (SPA) built with a modern web framework like React or Vue. The backend will be written in Rust and will be responsible for all the core prompt management logic.

## Feature Specification

- **Graphical Prompt Management**: All the core CRUD, search, and filtering features will be available through a user-friendly GUI.
- **Rich Text Editing**: A "what you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) editor or a code editor with syntax highlighting for editing prompts.
- **Drag and Drop**: The ability to drag and drop prompts to reorder them or organize them into folders.
- **Native OS Integration**: Use of native menus, notifications, and other OS-specific features.
- **Customization**: Options to customize the application's appearance and behavior.
